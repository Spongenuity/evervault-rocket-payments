# Evervault Integration Analysis

## Architecture Diagrams

### Current Architecture (Estimated)
- Customer enters card details in browser
- Data is sent to backend server
- Server handles encryption and PCI compliance
- Encrypted data sent to payment gateway
- High security and compliance burden on internal team

### Proposed Architecture with Evervault
- Customer enters card details in Evervault-secured form
- Data automatically encrypted in the browser
- Evervault Relay handles secure data transmission
- Clean handoff to payment gateway
- PCI compliance handled by Evervault

## Analysis: In-house vs Evervault

### In-house Tokenization
#### Pros
- Full control over implementation
- No additional vendor dependency
- One-time development cost

#### Cons
- PCI compliance burden (~$50K/year)
- Security team overhead (~1 FTE, $150K/year)
- Ongoing maintenance requirements
- Regular audit requirements
- Significant development time (3-6 months)
- Key rotation management

### Evervault Solution
#### Pros
- Immediate PCI compliance
- No dedicated security team needed
- Rapid implementation (1-2 weeks)
- Built-in audit trails
- Future-proof encryption
- Automated key rotation
- Reduced liability

#### Cons
- Monthly service cost
- Vendor dependency
